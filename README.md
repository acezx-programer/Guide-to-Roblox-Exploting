A Guide to Roblox Exploiting
in this Guide, i will tell you how to:
- Install and Execute a Roblox Exploit
- make a Roblox Script


## Levels Of Exploits
Levels are the Roblox Thread Identity that the script executed through the Roblox exploit is running. Normal LocalScripts run with Level 2, Roblox Scripts usually run with Level 3â€“4, the Command Bar on Roblox Studio runs with Level 5, and Plugins in Studio run in level 6. It is a common misconception that levels assosciate with how well an exploit is, but in reality, if you could already execute in Roblox, you could set the level. Most exploits run their scripts in Level 6 and intentionally downgrade their levels when calling certain functions in-game to avoid detection. Level 7 is an upper level that is commonly used in popular exploits such as Synapse X, Krnl, and JJsploit. The last and most advanced exploit level is level 8. Scripts running on this scale have access to every function and therefore provide the most "freedom" to script developers. Currently the only level 8 exploits are Script-Ware and Fluxus.

#### Below are A list of Roblox Executors

| Executors | Level    | Price        | Website               | Type               |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------     |:----------------------|  :-                |
| Synapse X | 7        |   Paid       |  https://x.synapse.to | Keyless|
| Script-Ware | 8 | Paid | https://script-ware.com | Needs Key|
| KRNL | 7 | Free | https://krnl.ca | Needs Key|      
| Trigon-Evo | 7 | Free |https://trigonevo.com | KRNL 

## How to Use them
Open up your Roblox exploit/executor and make sure the game you want to hack on is open.

Click Inject/Attach or whatever and give it 10 seconds, it may ask you for a key. Once you are done click Execute. It will load into Roblox and may/may not crash.
## How to Script
To Script, you need to learn coding
if you already learnt coding then you may use this tutorial as Guide:

## Example of Lua
```lua
local x
local y = 'Example here'
if y == 'Example Here' then
    print('Hello world!')
else
    print(y)
end
```
